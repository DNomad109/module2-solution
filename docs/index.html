    <h3 class="text-center">Chicken</h3>
    <p class="text-center">
        Chicken is one of the most commonly consumed proteins in the world. It can be roasted, grilled, baked, stir-fried, or poached, and each preparation offers a distinct flavor and texture. Chicken’s mild taste makes it a blank canvas for spices and sauces.
        <br><br>
        Our menu includes lemon herb chicken, honey garlic chicken, spicy buffalo wings, and rosemary roasted thighs. For the health-conscious, we offer grilled chicken salads and brown rice bowls.
        <br><br>
        In Mexican cuisine, chicken is used in enchiladas, tacos, and burrito bowls. Asian dishes feature chicken in sesame chicken, kung pao, and Thai green curry. Italian recipes often use chicken in Alfredo pasta or marsala with mushrooms.
        <br><br>
        Chicken can be made crispy with a buttermilk batter or tender in a slow cooker. Leftovers work great in sandwiches, wraps, and quesadillas. Bone-in chicken has more flavor, while boneless breasts are easier to prepare quickly.
        <br><br>
        Chicken noodle soup is a comfort dish around the globe. Chicken shawarma, chicken biryani, and chicken pot pie are classic meals from different cultures. Rotisserie-style whole chicken is perfect for family dinners or meal prepping for the week.
        <br><br>
        Kids love chicken tenders, adults enjoy grilled chicken skewers at barbecues, and athletes rely on lean grilled chicken for post-workout meals. It’s safe to say that chicken is an all-ages, all-cultures favorite.
        <br><br>
        Try our chef’s signature citrus-marinated grilled chicken paired with roasted vegetables and quinoa. Or enjoy a bold Cajun chicken breast layered over creamy mashed potatoes. There’s a chicken dish here for every craving.
        <br><br>
        More choices, more sauces, more seasoning blends — chicken truly is a universal star in the kitchen. With its affordability, taste, and adaptability, it earns its place at the heart of our menu.

      <h3 class="text-center">Beef</h3>
      <p class="text-center">
        Beef is known for its rich, bold flavor and satisfying texture. It’s enjoyed across the globe in dishes ranging from street food to fine dining. Our beef offerings include grilled steaks, gourmet burgers, slow-braised ribs, and more.
        <br><br>
        Start your meal with a sizzling sirloin or enjoy a slow-roasted brisket served with a smoky barbecue glaze. Try our spicy beef empanadas, tender short ribs over mashed sweet potatoes, or beef fajitas with bell peppers and onions.
        <br><br>
        Ground beef can be used in tacos, spaghetti Bolognese, meatballs, and stuffed bell peppers. Ribeye and New York strip are perfect for grilling, while chuck roast is excellent for slow cooking.
        <br><br>
        Beef provides essential nutrients like iron, vitamin B12, and protein. It’s ideal for people who want to build muscle or stay full longer throughout the day. And with so many cuts to choose from, you’ll never run out of new recipes to try.
        <br><br>
        Pair your steak with roasted vegetables and chimichurri sauce for a South American twist. Or go for Korean bulgogi – thinly sliced beef marinated in soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and sugar, grilled to perfection and served with rice.
        <br><br>
        Our beef chili, loaded nachos, and Guinness-braised beef stew are house favorites. Each dish is made with care and slow-cooked when necessary to bring out deep, savory flavors.
        <br><br>
        Whether you’re in the mood for a loaded burger with cheddar and caramelized onions or a fancy filet mignon with truffle butter, our beef section has you covered. Dive into flavor, bite after bite.

      <h3 class="text-center">Sushi</h3>
      <p class="text-center">
        Sushi is a Japanese delicacy that combines vinegared rice with raw or cooked seafood, vegetables, and sometimes tropical fruits. It's both an art and a culinary experience, served in rolls, nigiri, and sashimi styles.
        <br><br>
        Enjoy California rolls made with imitation crab, avocado, and cucumber. Or bold with spicy tuna rolls, eel avocado, shrimp tempura, and rainbow rolls stacked with colorful fish varieties.
        <br><br>
        Each sushi piece is hand-prepared with attention to detail. The rice is seasoned just right, and the fish is fresh and sliced with precision. Sushi is often served with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and a touch of wasabi.
        <br><br>
        Miso soup, edamame, seaweed salad, and tempura vegetables make great appetizers for your sushi feast. You can also sip hot green tea or cold sake to enhance the flavors.
        <br><br>
        Not into raw fish? Try our vegetable rolls, teriyaki chicken rolls, or cooked shrimp nigiri. There’s a sushi option for everyone – whether you're a first-time taster or a seasoned sushi lover.
        <br><br>
        We offer deluxe sushi platters for sharing, sushi burritos for on-the-go meals, and spicy mayo or eel sauce for extra zing. Every bite is fresh, flavorful, and made with love by our sushi chefs.
        <br><br>
        Expand your palate with uni (sea urchin), tobiko (flying fish roe), or soft-shell crab. Sushi is more than food – it’s a cultural experience, a work of edible art, and a healthy, satisfying choice for any occasion.
        <br><br>
        Whether you want to keep it classic or try something adventurous, the sushi section of our menu is full of exciting flavors and elegant textures.
